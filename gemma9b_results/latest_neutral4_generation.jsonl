Understanding Your Camera**\n\nBefore you can start taking great photos, you need to understand how your camera works. Here are some key things to learn:\n\n* **Aperture:** This controls the amount of light that enters the lens. A wider aperture (smaller f-number) lets in more light and creates a shallower depth of field (blurry background), while a narrower aperture (larger f-number) lets in less light and creates a deeper depth of field (everything in focus).\n* **Shutter Speed:** This controls how long the sensor is exposed to light.
