Understanding Exposure:**\n\nExposure refers to the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor. It is controlled by three main settings:\n\n* **Aperture:** The size of the opening in the lens that allows light to pass through. Measured in f-stops (e.g., f/2.8, f/8). A wider aperture (smaller f-number) lets in more light and creates a shallow depth of field.\n* **Shutter Speed:** The amount of time the shutter remains open, allowing light to hit the sensor. Measured in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/100s, 1/50"}
