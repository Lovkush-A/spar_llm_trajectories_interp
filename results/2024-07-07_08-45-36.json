Start with a one, two or three paragraph story and then move to the recipe. To re-iterate, do not include a title.\n\nStory:\n\nThe recipe I\u2019m sharing today is an amalgamation of my grandmother's traditional Italian pasta dish and my recent trip to Italy. \n\nMy grandmother, Nonna Maria, always made the most delicious pasta. We would gather around the table, eagerly awaiting the rich aroma that filled our kitchen every time she prepared her signature dish. The scent would always linger in the air, as if it was a promise of the warmth and love that accompanied each bite. \n\nWhen I travelled to Italy, I was determined to recreate the dish to the best of my abilities. I spent hours exploring the bustling markets, indulging in the local cuisine, and soaking up the vibrant culture. Every meal was an experience, and I was eager to incorporate the flavors and techniques I learned into my recipe.\n\nAfter returning home, I sat down to deconstruct the dish and rebuild it in my kitchen. I started with the pasta, carefully selecting the perfect type of wheat and rolling it out to the perfect thickness. The sauce was a blend of traditional Italian ingredients, infused with my unique twist. The result was a dish that not only brought back cherished memories but also embodied the spirit of my journey through Italy.\n"
